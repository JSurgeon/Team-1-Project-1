# Proposal:  Utilize The World Bank API to pull GPD related data for different countries. 

High Level Questions:
<br>Population Size vs GDP
<br>World Bank Income Level change overtime
<br>Distribution of GDP over the years of 2015-2019
<br>Heatmap of Highest and "Lowest" (zero/null) GDP's in the most recent year (2019)

# Note: config.py file needs your gmaps API key to run the code for the gmaps heatmap code as API key is not provided for security reasons.
