# Proposal:  Utilize The World Bank API to pull GPD related data for different countries. 

High Level Questions:
Population Size vs GDP,
World Bank Income Level change overtime,
Distribution of GDP over the years of 2015-2019
Heatmap of Highest and "Lowest" (zero/null) GDP's in the most recent year (2019)

Note: config.py file needs your gmaps API key to run the code for the gmaps heatmap code as API key is not provided for security reasons.
